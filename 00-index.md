# Planning a Custom Software Project: How We Would Do It

# Software Idea Workshop: A Hands-On Planning Guide

## Workshop Preparation

### Materials Needed

- Large whiteboards or wall-sized sticky note paper
- Colored sticky notes (multiple colors)
- Markers (thick and thin)
- Dot stickers for voting
- Blank templates for idea capturing
- Timer or smartphone
- Comfortable meeting space with wall space

### Participant Setup

- 5-10 participants
- Mix of roles:
  - Developers
  - Designers
  - Product managers
  - Potential users/stakeholders
  - Business representatives

## Workshop Stages

### 1. Divergent Thinking: Idea Generation (45-60 minutes)

#### Individual Ideation (20 minutes)

- Silent brainstorming
- Each participant writes ideas on sticky notes
- One idea per sticky note
- Encourage wild, creative thinking
- No criticism during this phase

#### Group Idea Sharing (25 minutes)

- Each person presents their ideas
- Place ideas on a central wall/board
- Group similar ideas naturally
- No debate, just understanding

### 2. Idea Clustering (30 minutes)

#### Thematic Grouping

- Participants collaboratively group similar ideas
- Create broad theme categories
- Use different colored sticky notes for themes
- Allow organic movement and discussion

#### Initial Voting

- Each participant gets 3-5 dot stickers
- Vote on most promising idea clusters
- Highest-voted clusters become focus areas

### 3. Idea Deep Dive (45 minutes)

#### Problem-Solution Mapping

- For top clusters, create:
  - Core problem statement
  - Target user/audience
  - Potential solution approaches
  - Key features
  - Rough value proposition

#### Rapid Prototyping

- Sketch basic UI/workflow
- Use simple paper prototypes
- Focus on core user experience
- Encourage quick, messy visualizations

### 4. Feasibility Assessment (45 minutes)

#### Skill and Resource Evaluation

- Create a skills matrix
- List required competencies
- Identify team's current capabilities
- Highlight skill gaps

#### Initial Scope Definition

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) outline
- Core features
- Nice-to-have features
- Technical complexity estimates

### 5. Action Planning (30 minutes)

#### Task Breakdown

- Convert top ideas into initial task lists
- Use sticky notes for individual tasks
- Color-code by type:
  - Research
  - Design
  - Development
  - Testing

#### Initial Timeline Sketch

- Create rough timeline
- Identify potential sprints
- Highlight key milestones
- Estimate rough time blocks

## Workshop Wrap-Up

### Final Deliverables

- Photographed whiteboards
- Digitized idea clusters
- Initial project outline
- Action item list
- Follow-up meeting schedule

### Next Steps Checklist

- Assign owners to key ideas
- Schedule detailed planning session
- Begin preliminary research
- Validate initial assumptions

## Workshop Facilitation Tips

### Facilitation Techniques

- Keep energy high
- Encourage equal participation
- Timebox each activity
- Stay focused on collaborative discovery
- Prevent dominant personalities from controlling discussion

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-analyzing initial ideas
- Getting stuck in theoretical discussions
- Losing momentum
- Ignoring "crazy" ideas too quickly

## Retrospective (15 minutes)

### Workshop Reflection

- What worked well
- What could be improved
- Key insights gained
- Excitement levels for next steps
