# How We Build In: D365

## Step 1: Resource planning

Since D365 is just a collection of modules and scopes, different packages allow you to do different things.

Need to consult to figure out which configurations are best for you

## Step 2: Feature Functionality and scope

**_Example_**: We want a customer funnel that takes in customer input, and loads them into our D365 Business Central, sets up background functionality, and communicates with them via email during the process.

Break it down into tasks and checkpoints.

**_Checkpoint #1_**: Do initial customer check and setup

**_Checkpoint #2_**: Perform analysis on data received and determine an output

## Step 3: Find Solutions for those Checkpoints
