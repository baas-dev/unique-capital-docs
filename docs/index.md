# Hello, Unique Capital!

It was a pleasure speaking with you a couple of weeks ago.

Our conversation left us eager to stay in touch, and so we wanted to:

1. Check in and see how everything is going
2. Give some complimentary guidance on adopting custom solutions into your company

In this documentation site, you will find two different articles:

1. **A short article discussing what it takes to adopt a successful IT operation.**
2. **Some information regarding how to successfully prepare to plan and start a custom IT project.**

We hope that this information is of some use to your organization. We understand that jumping into a project like the one's you are looking for can be overwhelming and daunting. But we really want to push how awesome and supportive a great system can be.

We look forward to hearing your feedback, and any questions you might have about this process.

Thank you!

Tom Miller & James Olabamiji
