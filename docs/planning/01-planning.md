# I. Scope Planning (20-25 Minutes)

## 1. Big Picture & Business Needs (5-7 Minutes)

- **What are the primary business challenges or opportunities you're trying to address with this software?** (Focus on the "why" behind the project)
- **Describe the overall vision for the software. What problems will it solve, and what positive impact will it have on your business?** (Think long-term)
- **Who are the primary users of this software, and what are their needs and pain points?** (Consider different user roles)
- **What are your key success metrics for this project? How will you measure its effectiveness?** (e.g., increased efficiency, cost savings, new customer acquisition)

## 2. Feature Brainstorming & Prioritization (10-12 Minutes)

- **List out all the features and functionalities you envision for the software, no matter how big or small.** (Encourage brainstorming)
- **Group these ideas into similar "families" or modules.** (Helps with organization)
- **For each feature/module, rank them in order of importance:**
  - **I. Required (Must-have for launch)**
  - **II. Recommended (Important, but can be added later)**
  - **III. Optional (Nice-to-have, future enhancements)**
- **For each "Required" feature, describe the specific tasks users will be able to perform.** (Detailed user stories are helpful here. Example: "As a sales manager, I want to be able to generate reports on sales performance so I can track progress against targets.")
